<h3>Bouncing Game</h3>

This is a bundle of two games: 

<ul>
  <li><b>Bouncing Balls:</b> Starting with a single ball bouncing on the screen, the user can add more balls and they will start colliding with each other. </li>
  <li><b>Bouncing Beetles:</b> With beetles bouncing on the screen, the goal of this game is to crush all the beetles before they reproduce. </li>
</ul>

Requirements: .NET Framework v4.0 or later.

This Project is built on Windows Forms. Tasks Parallel Library is being used to implement asynchronous behavior.

Understanding the code of this game is easy, even for new programmers.

I Hope you will find this repository valueable for you.
