<h3>Bouncing Game</h3>

(This project was built and tested in .NET Framework 4.6.1)

This is a bundle of two games: 

<ul>
  <li><b>Bouncing Balls:</b> Starting with a single ball bouncing on the screen, the user can add more balls and they will start colliding with each other. </li>
  <li><b>Bouncing Beetles:</b> With beetles bouncing on the screen, the goal of this game is to crush all the beetles before they reproduce. </li>
</ul>

This Project is built on Windows Forms (C#). Tasks Parallel Library is being used to implement asynchronous behavior.

Understanding the code of this game is easy, even for new programmers.

I Hope you will find this repository valuable for you.
